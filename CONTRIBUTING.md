## How to contribute

Firstly, ensure you have forked the repository and are working on a branch that is based off of our 'main' branch. If you're unsure about how to do this, there are many guides available online that will help.

Then follow these steps:
1. **Bugs**: Describe bugs by creating a new issue. Explain what you expected to see, what you saw instead, steps to reproduce it, and any additional context or screenshots that might be helpful.
2. **Feature requests**: Propose features by opening a new issue. Explain what the feature should do, how it would be used, and why you believe it would be a useful addition.
3. **Pull Requests**: Fix or add functionality to the project by making changes to the codebase yourself. Ensure that your code is following the coding standards outlined in the next section and make sure all tests pass before submitting a PR.
